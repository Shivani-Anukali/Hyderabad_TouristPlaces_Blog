                <p class="lead">Once home to the immensely famous Koh-i-Noor diamond, the majestic Golconda Fort should be your first stop on Day 2. Expansive, historic and intriguing, the fort offers an insight into life back when it was occupied and used mainly as a fortress to keep away enemies. Canon-mounted bastions, gateways and drawbridges are all reminders of the wars fought here. Spread over an area of 11 sq. km. the fort is cut out of granite rock and also houses royal apartments, the zenana, and places of worship, impressive stables and other structures that are worth seeing. Don’t leave without hiking up to the Bala Hissar pavilion right at the top where the sound of clapping made at the bottom of the hill at Fateh Darwaza, can be heard. How’s that for brilliant acoustics? There’s also a sound and light show in the evening which you can aim for.  </p>

                <p class="h1 fst-italic text-primary">Qutub Shahi Tombs</p>
                <p class="lead">Just a few minutes away from the hubbub of tourists at Golconda Fort lies the verdant, green complex of the Qutub Shahi Tombs in Ibrahim Bagh. Most people would skip it but we’d recommend a stop here to admire the architecture of the seven huge tombs where all the rulers of the namesake dynasty were laid to rest. Distinct from most other structures you see from the era, the tombs are made of black asphalt and are intricately carved. A beautiful site, the tombs are a great place to visit in Hyderabad on a 3 day trip.</p>

                <p class="h1 fst-italic text-white">Birla Temple</p>
                <p class="lead">One of the must-see places to visit in Hyderabad on a 3 day trip is the magnificent Birla Mandir sitting atop Naubat Pahad, just about a half hour car ride away from Golconda Fort. Dedicated to Lord Venkateshwara, this stunning white marble structure (nearly 2,000 tons of it carted from faraway Rajasthan!) is not only famous for its serene, calming atmosphere but also for its beautiful architecture that artfully mixes Rajasthani, Utkala and Dravidian styles together. Take the elevator up to the temple and enjoy beautiful views of the city and the Hussain Sagar Lake before calling it a day.</p>
