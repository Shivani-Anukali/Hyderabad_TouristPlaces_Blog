                <p class="h1 fst-italic text-primary">Salarjung Museum</p>
                <p class="lead">Start off your city tour with a visit to the famed Salarjung Museum, one of the best places to visit in Hyderabad in 3 days. A veritable (and frankly, eye-popping!) collection of artifacts from India, Persia, Egypt and Syria among other places fills up the 38 galleries housed in this impressive museum. Founded by Mir Yousuf Ali Khan, better known as Salar Jung III, part of a noble family of the erstwhile Hyderabad State, the museum is huge and would need several visits to see all the displays. Since you only have 3 days in Hyderabad, focus on only a few collections – the illustrated 13th century copies of the Quran, the veiled statue of Rebecca sculpted in Italian marble, the substantial Jade collection and of course the famed 200-year-old clock that is struck every hour, by a fascinating bearded man!</p>

                <p class="h1 fst-italic text-primary">Charminar</p>
                <p class="lead">Built in 1591 AD by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, to commemorate the end of plague, Charminar is the definitive Hyderabad icon. It is one of the best places to visit in Hyderabad in 3 days and frankly, you can’t miss it because it is right in the middle of the old city and you’ll cross it several times! Close to the Salarjung Museum, this impressive building was originally meant to be a mosque and affords beautiful views of the city, especially at night. Head up to the first floor via its beautiful spiral staircase and be charmed.</p>

                <p class="lead">History-laden and imposing, the recently restored 200-year-old Chowmahalla Palace is situated close to Charminar and is home to the Nizam’s personal collection of old photographs, vintage cars and antiques. Once the seat of the Asaf Jahi dynasty, this elegant royal compound was where the successive Nizams were nominated rulers and where most royal ceremonies and meetings took place. The complex consists of two courtyards and the magnificent chandeliered Durbar or Khilwat; if you only had 3 days in Hyderabad, this is one of the best places to visit.</p>
