                <p class="h1 fst-italic text-primary">Nehru Zoological Park</p>
                <p class="lead">Spread over 380-acres, the Nehru Zoological Park or the Hyderabad Zoo as it is fondly known is one of the best places to visit in Hyderabad on a 3-day trip, especially if you are traveling with kids. You’ll be forgiven the crusty old fort and the museum for a few hours at the zoo watching tigers, hippos, leopards, birds, reptiles and their ilk going about their business in enclosures that closely mimic their real habitat. Normally, it would require a whole day to see the entire zoo, but you can cut ahead with a quick spin on an hour long ride aboard a battery operated vehicle that takes you around the main enclosures. If you have more time, take the canter safari – we promise all-round delight!</p>

                <p class="lead">Constructed between 16th & 17th centuries by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the Mecca Masjid is one of the largest mosques in the world and among the oldest in India. A magnificent structure, it is revered by followers and tourists alike. If you only have 3 days in Hyderabad, spend some time to go see this imposing building for its brilliant domed roof – mentioned by the French traveler Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, who witnessed part of its construction, in his travelogue saying, “it is about 50 years since they began to build a splendid pagoda in the town which will be the grandest in all of India when it is completed.” Revel in its cascading fountain close to the entrance, its decorated façade that includes intricately carved arches and minarets. Non-Muslims are not allowed inside the mosque, but you can admire other features like the serene pool and marble tombs that are the final resting spot for some of the former rulers.</p>

                <p class="h1 fst-italic text-white">Hussain Sagar Lake</p>
                <p class="lead">The road skirting Hyderabad’s exceedingly impressive Hussain Sagar Lake is called the Necklace Road when lit up at night (because it resembles a pearl necklace) and is the best way to enjoy this magnificent man-made lake built by Ibrahim Qutub Quli Shah in 1563. Ice cream carts, walkers and families with children dot the sidewalk along the lake that is dominated by an imposing statue of Gautam Buddha. Taking a drive along the lake and visiting the adjoining Lumbini Park (that gives you close access to the statue) is one of the best Hyderabad experiences on a 3-day trip.</p>
